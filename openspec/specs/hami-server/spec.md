# HAMI Server HTTP API

## Purpose
The HAMI Server provides an HTTP API for programmatic access to HAMI functionality, enabling integration with external systems and web applications through RESTful endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Server Initialization
The system SHALL provide a basic HTTP server setup with Hono framework.

#### Scenario: Server startup
- **WHEN** the server is started
- **THEN** it listens on port 3000
- **AND** basic health check endpoints are available

### Requirement: Health Check Endpoint
The system SHALL provide a health check endpoint for monitoring.

#### Scenario: Health check request
- **WHEN** GET /health is requested
- **THEN** a JSON response with status 'ok' is returned
- **AND** the server availability is confirmed

### Requirement: Root Endpoint
The system SHALL provide a basic root endpoint for identification.

#### Scenario: Root request
- **WHEN** GET / is requested
- **THEN** a text response "Hami Server" is returned
- **AND** the server identity is confirmed

### Requirement: HTTP Framework Integration
The system SHALL use Hono framework for HTTP request handling.

#### Scenario: Hono app setup
- **WHEN** the server initializes
- **THEN** a Hono application instance is created
- **AND** routes are configured for API endpoints

### Requirement: Port Configuration
The system SHALL run on a configurable port with default 3000.

#### Scenario: Default port
- **WHEN** no port is specified
- **THEN** the server runs on port 3000
- **AND** startup message indicates the port

### Requirement: Export Structure
The system SHALL export server configuration for deployment.

#### Scenario: Module export
- **WHEN** the server module is imported
- **THEN** port and fetch handler are exported
- **AND** the server can be deployed in various environments

### Requirement: Future API Expansion
The system SHALL be structured to support future API endpoint additions.

#### Scenario: Extensible routing
- **WHEN** new functionality is added
- **THEN** additional routes can be easily added to the Hono app
- **AND** the existing health and root endpoints remain functional
