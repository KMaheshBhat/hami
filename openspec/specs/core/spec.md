# Core Plugin System

## Purpose
The HAMI Core Plugin System provides the fundamental architecture for extensible workflow components, enabling dynamic registration and instantiation of HAMINode and HAMIFlow classes through a plugin-based system.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Plugin Registration
The system SHALL provide a plugin registration mechanism that allows dynamic loading and management of HAMINode and HAMIFlow classes.

#### Scenario: Register a plugin
- **WHEN** a plugin is registered with the HAMIRegistrationManager
- **THEN** all node classes provided by the plugin are made available for instantiation
- **AND** the plugin is initialized and tracked

#### Scenario: Unregister a plugin
- **WHEN** a plugin is unregistered
- **THEN** all node classes from that plugin are removed from the registry
- **AND** the plugin is destroyed and cleaned up

### Requirement: Node Class Management
The system SHALL manage HAMINode and HAMIFlow class registration with unique kind identifiers.

#### Scenario: Register node class
- **WHEN** a node class is registered with a unique kind
- **THEN** it can be instantiated by kind name
- **AND** registration events are emitted

#### Scenario: Create node instance
- **WHEN** createNode is called with a registered kind
- **THEN** a new instance of the corresponding class is returned
- **AND** configuration validation is performed

### Requirement: Event System
The system SHALL provide an event system for monitoring registration lifecycle events.

#### Scenario: Registration events
- **WHEN** node classes are registered or unregistered
- **THEN** beforeRegister/afterRegister or beforeUnregister/afterUnregister events are emitted
- **AND** registered event handlers are called

### Requirement: Plugin Interface
The system SHALL define a standard plugin interface for consistent plugin development.

#### Scenario: Plugin initialization
- **WHEN** a plugin implements the HAMIPlugin interface
- **THEN** it provides name, version, description, and lifecycle methods
- **AND** it can be registered with the global registration manager

### Requirement: Global Registry
The system SHALL provide a global HAMIRegistrationManager instance for application-wide plugin management.

#### Scenario: Global access
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** hamiRegistrationManager is available for registering plugins
- **AND** all core nodes are automatically registered
